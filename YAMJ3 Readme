This is a quick and dirty port of eversion R0179 for YAMJ3.

Configuration:
--------------
There are three required settings in the esettings.xml file:
a) address and port of the YAMJ3 server
	<yamj3coreurl>http://127.0.0.1:8888/yamj3/</yamj3coreurl>

change the 127.0.0.1 address into the one where the YAMJ3 server is running (and eventually the 8888 port number)

b) scanner/player translation paths
	<yamj3librarypaths>D:\</yamj3librarypaths>
	<yamj3playerpaths>smb://[=]MYSERVER/DISK_D/</yamj3playerpaths>

change the library path to the root path on which the YAMJ3 file scanner was run (-d option of the scanner)
change the player path to reflect the player mount corresponding to the library path (i.e. samba mount)

c) server single query chunk size (optional, will default to 18)
	<yamj3chunksize>24</yamj3chunksize>

ideally equal to the maximal number of poster tiles on the movie screen (24 if wall configured as 3 rows 8 tiles each)
don't raise too much as eversion can run out of memeory.

Manual Installation:
--------------------
If you already have a Jukebox :

1) update the "Jukebox/eversion/player.swf" withe the one from distribution archive
("interface/eversion/player.swf").
2) Update your Jukebox's eversion settings ("MyJukebox/eversion/settings/esettings.xml") to include
the "yamj3coreurl", "yamj3librarypaths", "yamj3playerpaths" and "yamj3chunksize" (optional) settings.
Update the "eversion" release to "R3000".
3) Copy the "interface\eversion\settings\en.xml" file of the distribution and overwrite the Jukebox's one
4) Copy from the interface folder of the distribution the "eversion3.swf" into your Jukebox's folder


Limitations:
------------
- the YAMJ3 scrapper stores multiple fanart, banners, posters for each mediafile but only the first returned by the server is used 
- single file playback (no automatic multiple part playback, resume points etc)
- not all YAMJ3 specific warning/error messages support translations, some are hardwired into the code
- some indices are not supported (i.e HD, Set etc)

Bugs:
-----
Probably lots.

Comments:
---------
- tested only on PCH A400
- tested with evZap v1.2.1
- limited support for People MOD v5.4 to evZap
   - no People index
   - no individual person indices
   - each photo refference <file>[:@jukebox:]People/[:person@name:].jpg</file>
     has to be replaced with <file>[:person@photo:]</file>
